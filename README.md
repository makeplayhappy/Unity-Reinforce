# Unity-Reinforce


### History
Crosspile from Typescript to C# of a small subset of [Menno van Rahden's](https://github.com/mvrahden) Reinforcement Learning libraries [reinforce-js](https://github.com/mvrahden/reinforce-js/) and [recurrent-js](https://github.com/mvrahden/recurrent-js/) to be usable in C Sharp and Unity3D. Kudos to him for writing such an elegant library in TypeScript, some of the prettiest code I've stumbled upon! These are reachitecturings of [Andrej Karpathy's](https://github.com/karpathy/) excellent [reinforcejs](https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs) and [recurrentjs](https://github.com/karpathy/recurrentjs).  
  

Specifically this repository is to get the DQN solver from these libs working in Unity3D
 

Maybe working sometime in 2022, don't hold your breath!
